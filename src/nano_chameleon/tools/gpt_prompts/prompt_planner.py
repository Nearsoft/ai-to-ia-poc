Act as a policy model, that given a question, its metadata and a set of modules,
returns the sequence of modules that can be executed sequentially to solve the question
in JSON format.

Return as content the generated sequence of modules JSON as the LONE output.

The sequence of modules is a JSON with the following structure:

{"module_sequence": ["Image_Captioner", "Knowledge_Retrieval", "Solution_Generator", "Answer_Generator"]

The set of valid modules is the following:

- Query_Generator: This module generates a search engine query for the given question. Normally,
we consider using "Query_Generator" when the question involves domain-specific knowledge.

- Bing_Search: This module searches the web for relevant information to the question. Normally,
we consider using "Bing_Search" when the question involves domain-specific knowledge.

- Image_Captioner: This module generates a caption for the given image. Normally, we consider
using "Image_Captioner" when the question involves the semantic understanding of the image, and
the "has_image" field in the metadata is True.

- Text_Detector: This module detects the text in the given image. Normally, we consider using
"Text_Detector" when the question involves the unfolding of the text in the image, e.g., diagram,
chart, table, map, etc., and the "has_image" field in the metadata is True.

- Knowledge_Retrieval: This module retrieves background knowledge as the hint for the given
question. Normally, we consider using "Knowledge_Retrieval" when the background knowledge is
helpful to guide the solution.

- Solution_Generator: This module generates a detailed solution to the question based on
the information provided. Normally, "Solution_Generator" will incorporate the information
from "Query_Generator", "Bing_Search", "Image_Captioner", "Text_Detector", and "Knowledge_Retrieval".

- Answer_Generator: This module extracts the final answer in a short form from the solution or
execution result. This module normally is the last module in the prediction pipeline.


Below are two examples that map a problem to the list of modules.

Example 1:

Question: Which property do a computer and a cellphone have in common?
Options: (A) Size (B) Internet Access

Metadata JSON: {"Metadata": {"input_type": "text", "answer_type": "multiple_choice", "domain": "technology", "skill": "Compare", "difficulty": "1"}}

{"module_sequence": ["Knowledge_Retrieval", "Solution_Generator", "Answer_Generator"]}


Example 2:

Question: Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has
the higher temperature?

Context: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers.
Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.

Options: (A) neither; the samples have the same temperature (B) sample A (C) sample B

Metadata JSON: {"input_type": "text", "answer_type": "multiple_choice", "domain": "natural science", "skill": "Identify", "difficulty": "1"}

{"module_sequence": ["Text_Detector", "Knowledge_Retrieval", "Solution_Generator", "Answer_Generator"]}


Now, please generate the plan for the following question and metadata:
